# PyFiNeR: Fitting Near-infrared RR Lyrae light curves

 This routine implements the RR Lyrae near-infrared light curve fitting techniques described in Hajdu et al. (2018)

 The K-band light curve are fit with the Fourier transformed principal components coefficients; the H-band data is fit with the same light-curve shape; the shape of the J-band light curve is approximated with the K-band principal component amplitudes

 This routine was developed for:
 - Python 2.7
 - Numpy 1.12
 - Scipy 1.0
 - Matplotlib 2.1

## Installation

 Copy the files pyfiner, pyfiner.py, lcutil_pyfiner.py and coefs_pca.npz to the same directory in the system PATH

## Usage

 The routine requires six arguments to run; in order, these are:
 - COMMENT: a string that is passed printed out in the end; usually the name of the variable; can use quotation marks to carry additional information
 - PERIOD: the initial period estimate of the variable
 - FILE_K_LC: path of the K light curve file; must exist
 - FILE_J_LC: path of the J light curve file; must exist, but can be an empty file
 - FILE_H_LC: path of the H light curve file; must exist, but can be an empty file
 - OUTPUT.pdf: name of the output pdf file

 Given these arguments, the routine does the fit and gives back the following output:
 - COMMENT: the string from the argument list
 - PERIOD: the final period 
 - K_MAG: magnitude averaged mean K magnitude
 - K_INT: intensity averaged mean K magnitude
 - J_MAG_MEAN : magnitude averaged mean J magnitude, calculated with the mean offset
 - J_INT_MEAN : intensity averaged mean J magnitude, calculated with the mean offset
 - J_MAG_MEDI : magnitude averaged mean J magnitude, calculated with the median offset
 - J_INT_MEDI : intensity averaged mean J magnitude, calculated with the median offset
 - H_MAG_MEAN : magnitude averaged mean H magnitude, calculated with the mean offset
 - H_INT_MEAN : intensity averaged mean H magnitude, calculated with the mean offset
 - H_MAG_MEDI : magnitude averaged mean H magnitude, calculated with the median offset
 - H_INT_MEDI : intensity averaged mean H magnitude, calculated with the median offset
 - U1: amplitude of the first principal component of the K light curve
 - U2: amplitude of the second principal component of the K light curve
 - U3: amplitude of the third principal component of the K light curve
 - U4: amplitude of the fourth principal component of the K light curve
 - RMSE: the Root Mean Square Error of the K-band fit
 - COST: the final value of the Huber cost function
 - COSTN: the Uber cost function per K-band light curve cost
 - N_FINAL: the number of K-band light curve points in the final fit
 - N_INITIAL: the initial number of K-band light curve points
